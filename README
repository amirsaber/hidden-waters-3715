Report:
I made this application by considering NodeJs and AngularJs in my mind and I tried to show my understanding of models.
I didn't implement every aspects and layers of a real application to maintain simplicity of requested application on
the other hand I tried to separate components so a balance between simplicity and component base application has been
maintained.
My application is made of a REST API which handles requests
    1- /country/country_name like "/country/unit" will return json object of countries with "unit" at start of country name
    2- /customer/country_name like "/customer/canada" will return json object of customers who are in Canada
So AngularJs will make these request and populate web base data based on result of these type of request.
I also implement the application on Heroku cloud platform so it's possible to have a live demo on the link provided above
